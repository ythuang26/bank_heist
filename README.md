# Bank Heist Project Submission

**Description**

Given a list of bank, their locations, the amount of money each bank holds, and the amount of time it would take to rob each bank; apply your knowledge of algorithms to make as much profit as possible!

**Design a solution that finds a list of banks that when robbed will maximize your profit, while following these constraints:**

- Total time for robbery cannot exceed **24 hours**. This includes travel time between banks + time it takes to rob the bank + time it takes to get to the helicopter escape zone

- Travel speed from one bank to another is **30 km/h**
    - Use the x and y coordinates to calculate the distance (in km) between banks
    - Use the distance and travel speed to calculate the amount of time it takes to get from one bank to another

- Solution must run under **3 minutes**

- You can start anywhere, but you have to end at the **helicopter escape zone** located at coordinates **(0,0)**
